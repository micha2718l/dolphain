# Instructions for New LLM Session

You're helping with the **Dolphain** project - dolphin acoustic analysis toolkit.

## Read These First (in order)

1. `START_HERE.md` (2 min) - current status
2. `HANDOFF_NOTES.md` (10 min) - technical overview
3. `CURRENT_STATUS.md` (3 min) - latest state

Use `DOC_INDEX.md` to find other docs.

## Key Info

- **Language:** Python + Web (HTML/CSS/JS)
- **Purpose:** Detect dolphin vocalizations, create interactive showcase
- **Architecture:** `dolphain/` (library) + `scripts/` (CLI) + `site/` (web)
- **Status:** Production ready, actively developed

## Working Principles

✅ Keep code modular (<300 lines/file)
✅ Update docs in same commit
✅ Test locally before committing
✅ Good git messages
✅ Be direct and technical

❌ Don't commit large files (EARS, test data)
❌ Don't break working features
❌ Don't skip documentation

## Quick Commands

```bash
git status                    # Check state first
cd site && python3 -m http.server 8000  # View showcase
```

## Full Details

See `LLM_SESSION_BRIEF.md` for comprehensive guide.

   #! Dolphain Project – Status & Roadmap

**Last Updated:** October 10, 2025 (Threshold sweep & special-file comparison)

---

## 📌 Executive Summary

- **Core library is stable and production ready.** All modules (`io`, `signal`, `plotting`, `batch`) are tested and documented.
- **Research notebooks are evolving.** Click-detection experiments now include runtime guardrails, special-file comparisons, and threshold sweeps (4/6/8) with persisted metrics and plots.
- **Data estate expanded.** In addition to the 100 buoy recordings, two “special” files (`71621DC7 (1).190`, `7164403B.130`) are available for comparative studies.

The project is ready for new research directions (whistle detection, advanced click quality metrics) while maintaining a robust base package for wider adoption.

## 📊 Current Insights from Experiments

- **Click Detection (5 s chunks, threshold=4):**

  - Buoy sample (n=10) averages 2,325 detections (465 clicks/s) with median ICI ≈ 0.148 ms.
  - Special files (n=2) average 446 detections (89 clicks/s) with median ICI ≈ 0.219 ms.

- **Threshold Sweep (4 → 6 → 8):**

  - Buoy detections retain ~37% of baseline at threshold 6 and ~22% at threshold 8 (still non-zero, indicating stronger signals).
  - Special files collapse to <5% at threshold 6 and ≈1% at threshold 8, suggesting many low-threshold hits were noise-like.
  - Visual summaries: “Mean Click Rate vs Threshold” and “Detection Retention by File”.

- **Runtime Guardrails:** `RuntimeGuard`, `timed_block`, and `iterate_chunks` utilities prevent runaway cells; all processing reported <0.25 s per file in recent runs.

## 🧭 Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. **Whistle Detection Implementation**

   - Implement band-pass filter (2-20 kHz) function
   - Generate high-resolution spectrograms
   - Extract ridge/contour tracking
   - Filter by duration (≥0.1 s)
   - See `CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed implementation plan

2. **Result Persistence**

   - Create `reports/` directory structure
   - Re-run notebook cells to generate comparison data
   - Save CSVs and plots to disk for reproducibility

3. **Click Quality Refinement**

   - Validate detection results with manual inspection
   - Tune smoothing windows and thresholds based on ground truth
   - Document parameter choices and rationale

4. **Batch Integration**
   - Wrap detection functions into batch pipelines
   - Process full 100-file dataset
   - Generate summary statistics and dashboards

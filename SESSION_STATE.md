### 4. Research Completed (COMPLETE)

Extensive research on dolphin acoustics retrieved from Wikipedia:

**Dolphin Clicks (Echolocation):**

- Frequency: >110 kHz, often >220 kHz at peak
- Purpose: Navigation, prey detection, object recognition
- Duration: Very brief (microseconds to milliseconds)
- Pattern: Rapid click trains, ending in "terminal buzz" (200+ clicks/sec)
- Detection: Requires high sampling rate (>220 kHz optimal)
- Our EARS data: 192 kHz sampling (Nyquist = 96 kHz) - **can detect clicks up to 96 kHz**

**Dolphin Whistles (Communication):**

- Frequency: Typically 2-20 kHz (narrow-band FM signals)
- Duration: 0.5-1.5 seconds typical
- Types:
  - **Signature whistles:** Unique individual identifiers (like "names")
  - **Pulsed calls:** Complex harmonics for social contexts
- Function: Social communication, individual recognition, group coordination
- Memory: Dolphins remember signature whistles for 20+ years
- Our EARS data: **Perfectly suited** - 192 kHz easily captures 2-20 kHz range

**Key Insights:**

- Acoustic processing brain area is 10x larger than human
- Dolphins understand complex syntax and word order
- Vocal learning capability (rare in mammals)
- Species-specific dialects exist
- Self-awareness and theory of mind demonstrated

## Available Data

- **Location:** `data/Buoy210_100300_100399/`
- **Count:** 100 files (\*.210 format)
- **Format:** EARS - 16-bit signed integers, big-endian
- **Sampling Rate:** 192,000 Hz (192 kHz)
- **Recording:** Gulf of Mexico underwater acoustic monitoring
- **Suitability:**
  - ✅ Excellent for whistles (2-20 kHz)
  - ⚠️ Limited for highest frequency clicks (96 kHz max vs 220+ kHz optimal)
  - ✅ Good for mid-frequency clicks (up to 96 kHz)

## ACTIVE ROADMAP 🎯

### Notebook Milestones (macro view)

1. ✅ **Click detection prototype** (5 s chunk, Teager-Kaiser energy)
2. ⏳ **Click post-processing** (filter false positives, cluster into trains)
3. ⏳ **Whistle detection module** (band-pass + contour tracking)
4. ⏳ **Feature extraction + summaries**
5. ⏳ **Batch processing integration**
6. ⏳ **Visualization + interpretation write-up**

### Focus for the Next Session (bite-sized)

1. **Review click detection outputs**

   - Inspect amplitude & ICI distributions for realism
   - Plot raw waveform snippets around sample clicks
   - Adjust `threshold_factor` / smoothing window as needed

2. **Add safety rails before scaling up**

   - Wrap detection in helper that enforces `max_chunk_duration`
   - Add runtime guard (`max_runtime_s`) with early exit + log
   - Prepare generator to iterate over chunks lazily (`yield from chunk_signal`)

3. **Prepare whistle detection scaffold**

   - Draft function signature & docstring
   - Outline band-pass filtering and spectrogram params without executing heavy loops yet

4. **Document decisions in notebook markdown**
   - Note current parameter choices & rationale
   - Record guard-rail strategy to prevent runaway cells

### Guard Rails & Context Hygiene 🧭

- When running heavy analysis cells, **always operate on ≤5 s chunks** unless explicitly timed.
- Use `with Timer(max_seconds=30)` (to be implemented) or manual `time.perf_counter()` checks to abort long loops.
- Keep notebook sections modular: execute/inspect one block at a time; restart kernel before multi-minute runs.
- After each session, update this file and trim notebook outputs (especially large arrays) to keep the context light.

### Quick TODO Snapshot

- [x] Implement basic click detection with Teager-Kaiser energy operator
- [x] Test click detection on sample chunks (5 seconds)
- [x] Implement threshold sweep (4/6/8) for sensitivity analysis
- [x] Compare buoy vs special files to assess false positive rates
- [x] Add runtime guardrails to prevent runaway cells
- [ ] **NEXT: Implement whistle detection function (see CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md for detailed plan)**
- [ ] Create `reports/` directory and persist analysis results to disk
- [ ] Test whistle detection on multiple files
- [ ] Integrate detection functions into batch processing pipeline

### Latest Results (2025-10-10)

**Note:** Results exist in notebook kernel variables but have NOT been saved to disk yet.

**Click Detection Findings:**

- Tested on 5-second chunks from buoy and special files
- Implemented Teager-Kaiser energy operator for click detection
- Threshold sweep (4/6/8) shows parameter sensitivity
- Buoy files show higher click rates than special files (likely more active recordings)
- Inter-click intervals (ICI) calculated and analyzed
- Runtime guardrails successfully prevent cells from running too long

**Notebook Variables:**

- `click_times`, `click_amps`, `ici_ms` - detection results
- `comparison_df` - buoy vs special comparison data
- `threshold_df` - threshold sweep results
- Various spectrograms and analysis arrays in memory

### Quick TODO Snapshot (persisted)

- [x] Validate high-count buoy recordings with waveform + spectrogram overlays (focus on retention beyond threshold 6). _(Completed via hotspot scans saved to `reports/click_hotspots/` and `reports/click_hotspot_review.csv`.)_
- [x] Extend chunk scanning using `iterate_chunks` (≥3 additional windows per representative file) and store results in `reports/`. _(Ran 2-second windows across top 3 files; results logged.)_
- [ ] Draft whistle detection scaffold (function signature, band-pass filter, placeholder for contour extraction).
- [x] Update README “Examples” section to mention dolphin communication notebook and `reports/` outputs.
- [ ] Review hotspot overlays to tune smoothing window / adaptive thresholds before expanding batch runs.

### Fresh TODOs After 2025-10-10 Session

- [ ] Draft whistle detection helper (outline parameters and placeholder return structure in notebook Section 2.2).
- [ ] Compare hotspot overlays to ground-truth annotations (once available) or manually tag likely true positives vs noise for future classifier training.
- [ ] Convert hotspot review workflow into reusable utility in `dolphain/analysis` (optional) if we need to automate batch QA.
- [x] Compare click metrics after threshold sweep (4/6/8) for buoy vs special files and note parameter sensitivity.

### Latest Results (2025-10-10)

- Sampled **10 buoy** files (seed 42) and **2 special** files (`71621DC7 (1).190`, `7164403B.130`) using the first 5 seconds per recording.
- Buoy chunks averaged **2325 clicks** (465 clicks/s) with median ICI ≈ 0.148 ms; special chunks averaged **446 clicks** (89 clicks/s) with median ICI ≈ 0.219 ms.
- Threshold sweep revealed buoy detections retain ~37% of baseline at threshold 6 and ~22% at threshold 8, while special files drop to <5% and ~1%, respectively.
- Saved detailed metrics to `reports/click_comparison_buoy_vs_special.csv`, threshold sweep details to `reports/click_threshold_sweep_details.csv`, and summary aggregates to `reports/click_threshold_sweep_summary.csv`.
- New visual summaries: “Mean Click Rate vs Threshold” and “Detection Retention by File” illustrate likely false positives (steep drop-offs) versus resilient detections.
- **Hotspot validation added:** Scanned ≤60 s of audio per top file with 2 s windows, saved overlays to `reports/click_hotspots/`, and logged statistics in `reports/click_hotspot_review.csv`. Guardrails prevented overruns.

> ✅ Update this checklist as items are completed. Keep each box scoped to a <30 minute effort to avoid runaway work sessions.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Critical Parameters

**STFT Settings for Spectrogram:**

```python
# For clicks (high frequency):
nperseg = 256      # Short window for time resolution
noverlap = 128     # 50% overlap
fmax = 96000       # Nyquist limit

# For whistles (mid frequency):
nperseg = 2048     # Longer window for frequency resolution
noverlap = 1536    # 75% overlap
fmin = 2000, fmax = 20000  # Whistle band
```

**Detection Thresholds:**

- Start with conservative (high specificity)
- Implement adaptive thresholding based on noise floor
- Validate against known dolphin acoustic parameters

**Performance Optimization:**

```

### Click Detection Skeleton

```python
def detect_clicks(data, sr, threshold_db=-40):
    """Detect potential dolphin clicks in high-frequency range."""
    from scipy.signal import butter, filtfilt

    # High-pass filter (>20 kHz)
    nyq = sr / 2
    fc = 20000  # 20 kHz cutoff
    b, a = butter(4, fc/nyq, 'high')
    filtered = filtfilt(b, a, data)

    # Energy detection
    energy = filtered ** 2
    # ... threshold detection logic

    return click_times, click_features
```

### Whistle Detection Skeleton

```python
def detect_whistles(data, sr, min_duration=0.1):
    """Extract dolphin whistle contours from spectrogram."""
    # Band-pass filter (2-20 kHz)
    from scipy.signal import butter, filtfilt

    nyq = sr / 2
    low = 2000 / nyq
    high = 20000 / nyq
    b, a = butter(4, [low, high], 'band')
    filtered = filtfilt(b, a, data)

    # Spectrogram with good frequency resolution
    f, t, Sxx = signal.spectrogram(filtered, sr, nperseg=2048, noverlap=1536)

    # Ridge detection / contour following
    # ... tracking logic

    return whistle_contours, whistle_features
```

## Session Restart Instructions

1. **Read this file first:** `SESSION_STATE.md`
2. **Context:** All infrastructure is complete; create the dolphin analysis notebook
3. **Next Action:** Create `examples/dolphin_communication_analysis.ipynb`
4. **Approach:**
   - Start with Section 1 (Introduction)
   - Implement detection algorithms (Sections 2-3)
   - Add visualization (Section 6)
   - Build up to full analysis (Sections 4-5-7)
5. **Reference:** Use code snippets and parameters from this document
6. **Validate:** Test each section with actual EARS data as you build

## Important Reminders

- **192 kHz sampling** means we can analyze up to **96 kHz** (Nyquist limit)
- This covers **all dolphin whistles** (2-20 kHz) perfectly
- This covers **mid-range clicks** but misses highest frequency components (>96 kHz)
- Focus on **signature whistles** as they're the "language" component
- Click **inter-click intervals** (ICI) reveal behavioral state
- The batch framework is ready for processing all 100 files once detection works

# üöÄ Performance Optimization Complete

## Speed Improvements

### Before Optimization
- **15.14 seconds per file** (1.4x realtime)
- Finding **39,480 chirps** per file (too many!)
- Estimated **252 minutes** for 1000 files (~4.2 hours)

### After Optimization  
- **1.89 seconds per file** (11.3x realtime)
- Finding **~1,000-2,000 chirps** per file (reasonable)
- Estimated **31.5 minutes** for 1000 files (~0.5 hours)

### Result: **8x Speedup! ‚ö°Ô∏è**

## What Was Changed

### 1. Larger FFT Window
- Changed from 2048 to 4096 samples
- Better frequency resolution
- Fewer time steps to process

### 2. Less Overlap
- Reduced from 75% to 50% overlap
- Faster processing, still good time resolution

### 3. Higher Power Threshold
- Increased from 80th to 90th percentile
- More selective about what counts as a "strong" signal
- Filters out noise and weak features

### 4. Better Ridge Detection
- Find local maxima in frequency direction at each time
- Require peaks to be higher than neighbors in both time AND frequency
- Much more selective

### 5. Limited New Chirp Creation
- Only start new chirps from top 5 strongest peaks at each time
- Prevents explosion of weak/noisy chirps
- Focus on the most prominent features

### 6. Stricter Filtering
- Increased minimum duration from 0.05s to 0.1s
- Increased minimum sweep from 500 Hz to 1000 Hz
- Filters out small frequency wobbles

## Test Results (5 files)

All 5 files had both chirps and click trains:
- **Top score: 62.8** (2016 chirps, 2228 clicks in 12 trains)
- Processing speed: **0.5 files/second**
- Total time: **9.5 seconds** for 5 files
- All files successfully processed

## Ready for Production Run

The algorithm is now:
- ‚úÖ Fast enough for large-scale processing
- ‚úÖ Finding reasonable number of features
- ‚úÖ Properly filtering noise
- ‚úÖ Detecting both chirps and click trains
- ‚úÖ Scoring working correctly

## Commands

### Test Run (Quick validation)
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && python scripts/quick_find.py \
  --file-list outputs/ears_files_list.txt \
  --n-files 10 \
  --output-dir test_quick
```

### Production Run (1000 files)
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && python scripts/quick_find.py \
  --file-list outputs/ears_files_list.txt \
  --n-files 1000 \
  --output-dir CLICK_CHIRP_001
```

Expected completion time: **~30-35 minutes**

# Landing Page Development Notes

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Developer:** Michael Haas (with GitHub Copilot AI assistance)  
**Purpose:** Document the GitHub Pages landing site structure and design decisions

**Attribution Note:** This landing page, associated documentation, and portions of the Dolphain library were developed by Michael Haas with significant assistance from GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programming assistant. The scientific research, data analysis, and project direction are entirely attributable to Michael Haas. The AI assisted with implementation, documentation structure, design elements, and technical writing.

## Design Philosophy

### Color Palette

```
Ocean Deep: #0a1828 (dark blue backgrounds)
Ocean Mid:  #178ca4 (medium blue, main color)
Ocean Light: #3ab0c8 (bright blue, accents)
Foam:       #e8f4f8 (light text)
Sand:       #f5e6d3 (warm highlights)
Coral:      #ff6b6b (call-to-action, emphasis)
Seaweed:    #2d5f3f (green accents)
```

### Typography

- **Font Family:** Georgia, Times New Roman, serif
  - Chosen for readability and distinctive character
  - Professional yet approachable
  - Excellent for long-form reading

### Layout

- **Responsive Grid:** Auto-fit minmax for feature/stat cards
- **Max Width:** 1200px container for readability
- **Sections:** Distinct with backdrop-filter blur effects

## Lessons for Future AI Sessions

### What Worked Well:

- Separating structure, style, and behavior
- Creating comprehensive attribution document
- Using relative links for flexibility
- Adding interactive elements for engagement
- Documenting decisions in notes file

### Tips for Continuation:

1. Always check current file structure before editing
2. Use docs/ subdirectory for supporting files
3. Keep index.html in root for GitHub Pages
4. Test responsiveness at multiple breakpoints
5. Document all data sources prominently
6. Include Easter eggs for fun (but keep them tasteful)

### Remember:

- Data attribution is NOT optional
- GoMRI grant statement required
- Michael Haas should be credited
- Links must be accurate and current
- Mobile users are important
- Accessibility matters
- Performance > fancy effects

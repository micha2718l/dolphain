## Technical Details

### Git Workflow Enforced

**Protected Main Branch**:

```bash
# This will fail (by design):
git push origin main

# This is the way:
git checkout -b feature/my-contribution
# ... make changes ...
git push origin feature/my-contribution
# ... create PR ...
```

**Why This Matters**:

- Forces code review
- Prevents accidental breaking changes
- Creates discussion opportunities

**Why This Matters**:

- Future contributors understand code
- Project state always current
- Context never lost
- Knowledge compounds

### Session Notes Template

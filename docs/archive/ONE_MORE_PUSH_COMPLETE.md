## 🎯 What You Asked For

> "Make one more push to make things amazing. Update the site to include a section showing off some of the features of the library. If you need to run some things to create example output, do that. Also, it might be a good idea to move the site to another folder, I can change the github pages setting to deploy from there."

## ✅ What Was Delivered

### 1. ⭐ Real Examples Section

**Added to the site:**

- Three professional visualizations generated from **real EARS data**
- **Waveform:** 21-second underwater recording from Gulf of Mexico
- **Spectrogram:** Frequency analysis showing dolphin communication bands
- **Denoising:** Before/after comparison of wavelet filtering

**Each example includes:**

- High-quality image (100 DPI, web-optimized)
- Explanation of what it shows
- Code snippet showing how to reproduce it
- Scientific context

### 2. 🗂️ Site Moved to `/site` Directory

**New structure:**

```
site/
├── index.html          # Enhanced with examples section
├── css/style.css       # Added example-specific styling
├── js/script.js        # Interactive features
├── images/             # ⭐ NEW: Real visualizations
│   ├── waveform.png
│   ├── spectrogram.png
│   └── denoising.png
├── DATA_ATTRIBUTION.md
└── README.md
```

### 3. 🔧 Generation Script

**Created `generate_examples.py`:**

- Reads actual EARS data file
- Generates three publication-quality visualizations
- Uses the Dolphain library's own functions
- Outputs to `site/images/`
- Can be re-run anytime to update examples

### 4. 📝 Enhanced Documentation

**New files:**

- `site/README.md` - Site-specific documentation
- `FINAL_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
- Updated CSS with example styling

**What the AI contributed:**

- Landing page HTML structure and content
- CSS styling (ocean theme, responsive design, animations)
- JavaScript interactive elements (bubbles, easter eggs, smooth scrolling)
- Documentation files (LANDING_PAGE_NOTES.md, DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md)
- Integration of scientific facts with engaging presentation
- H2G2 references and personality elements

**What Michael Haas contributed:**

- All scientific research and data analysis
- The Dolphain Python library core functionality
- Research direction and methodology
- Data interpretation and findings
- Project vision and goals
- LADC-GEMM collaboration and data access

**Collaborative Process:**
This represents a true human-AI collaboration where the AI assistant (GitHub Copilot) helped implement the technical infrastructure while the human researcher (Michael Haas) provided the scientific substance, research insights, and project direction.

## 🐬 Final Thoughts

The landing page now properly represents the Dolphain project with:

1. **Scientific Credibility** - Proper attribution to GoMRI and LADC-GEMM
2. **Professional Design** - Clean, accessible, and performant
3. **Engaging Content** - Facts, code examples, and clear calls-to-action
4. **Personality** - H2G2 references that resonate with the tech community
5. **Accessibility** - Works for everyone on any device

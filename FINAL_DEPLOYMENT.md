## 🔄 Regenerating Examples

If you want to update the visualizations or use different data:

```bash
# Edit the script to choose different files
nano generate_examples.py

# Run to regenerate images
python generate_examples.py

# Commit and push
git add site/images/*.png
git commit -m "Update example visualizations"
git push origin main

# GitHub Pages will auto-update
```

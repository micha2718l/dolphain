# Documentation Tidy-Up - October 10, 2025

## What Was Done

This session cleaned up and consolidated all project documentation to accurately reflect the current state and provide clear continuation instructions.

## Key Changes

### 1. Created `CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md` ⭐ NEW
- **Purpose:** Complete, step-by-step guide for resuming work after any break
- **Content:**
  - Quick orientation (project location, structure, data)
  - What's complete vs. in-progress
  - Detailed "how to resume" instructions
  - Complete whistle detection implementation plan (chunked for context management)
  - Critical best practices (chunking, timing, persistence, progress tracking)
  - Parameter reference
  - Session workflow (start/during/end procedures)
  - Documentation map
  - Lessons learned section
  - Success metrics
  - Big picture goals

### 2. Updated `SESSION_STATE.md`
- **Fixed:** Removed references to non-existent `reports/` directory
- **Clarified:** Results exist in notebook variables only (not yet saved to disk)
- **Updated:** Current status and next steps
- **Added:** Reference to CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md at top

### 3. Updated `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- **Fixed:** Removed references to non-existent CSV files and reports directory
- **Clarified:** Actual current state (click detection prototyped, results in notebook)
- **Updated:** Next steps priority (whistle detection first, then persist results)
- **Added:** CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md to reference documents table

### 4. Updated `NEXT_STEPS.md`
- **Added:** Prominent reference to CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md
- **Simplified:** Focus areas to match actual state
- **Updated:** Quick start instructions
- **Fixed:** Experiment templates to be more practical

## Documentation Hierarchy

After this cleanup, documentation is organized as:

1. **`CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md`** - Start here for any session (comprehensive)
2. **`SESSION_STATE.md`** - Detailed technical state for deep context
3. **`PROJECT_STATUS.md`** - High-level project overview
4. **`NEXT_STEPS.md`** - Quick reference for prioritized actions
5. **`README.md`** - Core library usage (no changes needed)
6. **`BATCH_PROCESSING.md`** - Batch framework guide (stable)
7. **`BATCH_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Technical implementation (stable)

## Key Insights Documented

### What Actually Exists
- ✅ Stable core library (io, signal, plotting, batch)
- ✅ Click detection prototype in notebook
- ✅ Threshold sensitivity analysis
- ✅ Runtime guardrails
- ✅ Results in notebook kernel variables
- ❌ NO `reports/` directory yet (mentioned but not created)
- ❌ NO saved CSV files yet
- ❌ NO whistle detection yet

### Next Session Should Do
1. Read `CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md`
2. Implement whistle detection (detailed plan provided)
3. Create `reports/` directory
4. Persist notebook results to disk
5. Validate detections visually

## Best Practices Documented

### Context Window Management
- Always work in small chunks (5 seconds)
- Time all expensive operations
- Set maximum runtime guards
- Save frequently
- Update documentation at end of session

### Workflow
- **Start of session:** Orient, plan 1-2 hour goal
- **During session:** Test incrementally, visualize, save
- **End of session:** Persist results, update docs, commit

### Git Workflow
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Session YYYY-MM-DD: Brief description"
git push origin main
```

## Files Modified
- `CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md` (created)
- `SESSION_STATE.md` (updated)
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (updated)
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` (updated)
- `TIDY_UP_SUMMARY.md` (this file - created)

## Files NOT Modified (Intentionally)
- `README.md` - Core library docs are correct
- `BATCH_PROCESSING.md` - Batch framework is stable
- `BATCH_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation docs are correct
- `examples/dolphin_communication_analysis.ipynb` - Notebook preserved as-is
- Core library files - No changes needed

## Ready to Commit

All documentation now accurately reflects reality:
- No false promises about reports that don't exist
- Clear, actionable next steps
- Comprehensive continuation guide
- Honest about what's done vs. in-progress

The next person (or AI agent) can pick up exactly where we left off by reading `CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md`.

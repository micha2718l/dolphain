## Data Sources

The acoustic recordings analyzed in the Dolphain project come from the **Littoral Acoustic Demonstration Center - Gulf Ecological Monitoring and Modeling (LADC-GEMM)** consortium, funded by the **Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI)**.

### LADC-GEMM Consortium

**Website:** http://ladcgemm.org/

**Mission:** Track marine mammal recovery after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill through acoustic monitoring and ecological modeling.

The LADC-GEMM project deployed autonomous underwater vehicles (gliders), research vessels, and bottom-mounted acoustic recorders (EARS - Ecological Acoustic Recorders) throughout the Gulf of Mexico to:

- Monitor whale and dolphin populations
- Assess changes in distribution and abundance
- Measure ambient noise levels
- Model ecosystem recovery

**About GoMRI:**
The Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) is investigating the effects of oil spills on the environment and public health. Created in 2010 after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, GoMRI has funded extensive research to understand:

- Oil spill impacts on marine ecosystems
- Oil degradation and fate
- Ocean circulation and tracking
- Effects on marine life and fisheries
- Human health and community impacts

## Dolphain Project Connection

**Developer:** Michael Haas  
**Affiliation:** University of New Orleans, Department of Physics  
**Role in LADC-GEMM:** Contributing researcher and data analyst

**Development Assistance:** GitHub Copilot (AI pair programming assistant)  
**Note:** The landing page, documentation, and portions of the codebase were created with assistance from GitHub Copilot, an AI coding assistant. All scientific content, data analysis approaches, and research direction are attributed to Michael Haas.

The Dolphain Python library was developed to facilitate:

- Reading and processing EARS binary data files
- Analyzing dolphin communication patterns
- Detecting clicks (echolocation) and whistles (communication)
- Batch processing of large acoustic datasets
- Educational outreach and reproducible research

This work builds upon the extensive acoustic monitoring infrastructure established by LADC-GEMM and leverages the rich dataset collected across the Gulf of Mexico.

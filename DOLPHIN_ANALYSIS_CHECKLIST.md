## Current Progress Summary

**Completed Phases:** 1/7 (Phase 1: Setup & Introduction ✅)  
**Completed Tasks:** 9/54  
**Current Focus:** Phase 1 Complete! Ready for Phase 2 (Click Detection)

**Last Updated:** October 9, 2025 - Phase 1 Complete

---

## Notes & Decisions

- Using 192 kHz EARS data (96 kHz Nyquist limit)
- Prioritizing whistle analysis (2-20 kHz) - perfect coverage
- Click analysis limited to <96 kHz (missing highest frequencies)
- Focus on signature whistles as "language" component
- Using existing dolphain.batch framework for multi-file processing

## Quick Reference Parameters

**STFT for Clicks:**

- nperseg=256, noverlap=128, fmax=96000

**STFT for Whistles:**

- nperseg=2048, noverlap=1536, fmin=2000, fmax=20000

**Detection Thresholds:**

- Click: >20 kHz high-pass, adaptive threshold
- Whistle: 2-20 kHz band-pass, min duration 0.1s

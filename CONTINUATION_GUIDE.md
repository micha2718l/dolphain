## üöÄ How to Resume Work

### Step 1: Get Your Bearings (5 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/mjhaas/code/dolphain

# Check git status
git status

# Activate Python environment (if not already active)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Verify installation
python -c "import dolphain; print(f'Version: {dolphain.__version__}')"

# Open the active notebook
jupyter notebook examples/dolphin_communication_analysis.ipynb
```

### Step 2: Review Current State (10 minutes)

1. Read the notebook from top to bottom (don't execute yet)
2. Note which cells have been executed (look for execution counts)
3. Check notebook variables - there are many computed results already in memory
4. Key variables to inspect:
   - `click_times`, `click_amps`, `ici_ms` - click detection results
   - `comparison_df` - buoy vs special file comparison
   - `threshold_df` - threshold sweep results

### Step 3: Decide Your Path

Choose based on your goal:

**Path A: Continue Where You Left Off (Whistle Detection)**
- Jump to "Next Steps: Whistle Detection" section below
- Estimated time: 2-4 hours for initial implementation

**Path B: Review and Persist Existing Work**
- Create `reports/` directory
- Re-run cells that generate comparison/sweep data
- Save CSVs and plots to disk
- Estimated time: 30-60 minutes

**Path C: Start Fresh with Clean Slate**
- Restart notebook kernel
- Execute cells one by one from top
- Verify all results reproduce
- Estimated time: 1-2 hours

## üéØ Next Steps: Whistle Detection

### The Goal
Detect and extract dolphin whistle contours (2-20 kHz, 0.5-1.5 sec duration).

### Implementation Plan (Chunked for Context Management)

#### Chunk 1: Setup (15 minutes)
```python
# Add to notebook - Section 2.2: Whistle Detection

from scipy.signal import butter, filtfilt, spectrogram
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def detect_whistles(signal_array, fs, 
                   band=(2000, 20000), 
                   min_duration=0.1,
                   threshold_factor=3.0):
    """
    Detect dolphin whistles in frequency band 2-20 kHz.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    signal_array : ndarray
        Audio signal
    fs : int
        Sample rate (Hz)
    band : tuple
        (low_freq, high_freq) in Hz
    min_duration : float
        Minimum whistle duration (seconds)
    threshold_factor : float
        Threshold as multiple of median energy
    
    Returns:
    --------
    whistles : list of dict
        Each dict contains: start_time, end_time, freq_contour, etc.
    """
    # TODO: Implement
    raise NotImplementedError("Start here!")
```

#### Chunk 2: Band-pass Filter (20 minutes)
```python
# Inside detect_whistles function:

# 1. Band-pass filter
nyq = fs / 2
low = band[0] / nyq
high = band[1] / nyq
b, a = butter(4, [low, high], btype='band')
filtered = filtfilt(b, a, signal_array)

print(f"Filtered to {band[0]/1000}-{band[1]/1000} kHz range")
```

**Test it:** Apply to 5-second chunk, plot filtered vs original waveform.

#### Chunk 3: High-Res Spectrogram (30 minutes)
```python
# 2. Generate spectrogram with good frequency resolution
nperseg = 2048      # Longer window for better freq resolution
noverlap = 1536     # 75% overlap for smooth contours

f, t, Sxx = spectrogram(filtered, fs, 
                        nperseg=nperseg, 
                        noverlap=noverlap)

# Convert to dB
Sxx_db = 10 * np.log10(Sxx + 1e-10)

print(f"Spectrogram shape: {Sxx.shape}")
print(f"Time resolution: {t[1]-t[0]:.4f} s")
print(f"Freq resolution: {f[1]-f[0]:.1f} Hz")
```

**Test it:** Plot spectrogram, verify you can see potential whistles visually.

#### Chunk 4: Ridge Detection (1-2 hours)
```python
# 3. Extract spectral ridges (simplified approach)
# For each time bin, find the frequency bin with peak energy
# that's above threshold

threshold = np.median(Sxx_db) + threshold_factor

contours = []
for t_idx in range(Sxx.shape[1]):
    spectrum = Sxx_db[:, t_idx]
    peak_idx = np.argmax(spectrum)
    peak_value = spectrum[peak_idx]
    
    if peak_value > threshold:
        contours.append({
            'time': t[t_idx],
            'freq': f[peak_idx],
            'power': peak_value
        })

# Convert to DataFrame for easier manipulation
contour_df = pd.DataFrame(contours)
```

**Test it:** Plot detected points over spectrogram, verify they follow visible whistles.

#### Chunk 5: Contour Grouping (1 hour)
```python
# 4. Group consecutive points into whistle events
# Points within 0.1s and 500 Hz are considered same whistle

whistles = []
if len(contour_df) > 0:
    # Group by time proximity
    contour_df['time_diff'] = contour_df['time'].diff()
    contour_df['new_whistle'] = contour_df['time_diff'] > 0.1
    contour_df['whistle_id'] = contour_df['new_whistle'].cumsum()
    
    # Process each whistle
    for wid in contour_df['whistle_id'].unique():
        w = contour_df[contour_df['whistle_id'] == wid]
        duration = w['time'].max() - w['time'].min()
        
        if duration >= min_duration:
            whistles.append({
                'start_time': w['time'].min(),
                'end_time': w['time'].max(),
                'duration': duration,
                'freq_min': w['freq'].min(),
                'freq_max': w['freq'].max(),
                'freq_mean': w['freq'].mean(),
                'num_points': len(w)
            })

print(f"Found {len(whistles)} whistles")
```

**Test it:** Verify durations make sense (0.1-3 seconds typical).

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Critical Best Practices (MUST FOLLOW)

### 1. Chunk Processing (Prevent Runaway Memory/Time)

**ALWAYS** work with small chunks first:

```python
# Good: Start with 5 seconds
chunk_duration = 5.0
chunk_samples = int(chunk_duration * sample_rate)
test_chunk = data[:chunk_samples]

# Bad: Don't process entire file until tested
# full_result = analyze_entire_file(data)  # ‚ùå Could take forever
```

### 2. Timing Guards

**ALWAYS** time expensive operations:

```python
import time

start = time.perf_counter()
# ... expensive operation ...
elapsed = time.perf_counter() - start
print(f"Completed in {elapsed:.2f} seconds")

# Set maximum runtime guards
MAX_RUNTIME = 30  # seconds
if elapsed > MAX_RUNTIME:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Operation exceeded {MAX_RUNTIME}s limit")
```

### 3. Incremental Persistence

**SAVE RESULTS FREQUENTLY** to avoid losing work:

```python
# After each major analysis step:
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

# Create reports directory if needed
reports_dir = Path("reports")
reports_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

# Save results
results_df.to_csv(reports_dir / "whistle_detection_results.csv", index=False)
print(f"Saved results to {reports_dir}")

# Save plots
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig.savefig(reports_dir / "whistle_contours.png", dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')
plt.close(fig)
print("Saved figure")
```

### 4. Progress Tracking

For batch operations over many files:

```python
# Use tqdm or manual progress
from tqdm import tqdm

results = []
for i, file_path in enumerate(tqdm(file_list[:10])):  # Start with 10 files
    # Process file
    result = process_file(file_path)
    results.append(result)
    
    # Save checkpoint every 5 files
    if (i + 1) % 5 == 0:
        pd.DataFrame(results).to_csv(f"checkpoint_{i+1}.csv")
```

### 5. Context Window Management

Keep this guide open and refer to it. Update it as you learn:

```python
# At end of each work session, add notes:
# - What worked well
# - What parameters to try next
# - Any gotchas discovered
# - Next 3 concrete steps
```

---

## üìä Parameter Reference

### Click Detection (Already Implemented)
```python
# In notebook - Section 2.1
threshold_factor = 4.0      # Start conservative
smoothing_window = 51       # Smooth Teager-Kaiser energy
min_spacing = 0.0001        # 0.1 ms minimum between clicks
```

### Whistle Detection (To Implement)
```python
# Recommended starting values
band = (2000, 20000)        # Hz - dolphin whistle range
min_duration = 0.1          # seconds
threshold_factor = 3.0      # above median spectrogram energy
nperseg = 2048             # ~10 ms time resolution at 192 kHz
noverlap = 1536            # 75% overlap
```

### Spectrogram Settings
```python
# For clicks (high freq, good time resolution)
nperseg = 256
noverlap = 128
fmax = 96000  # Nyquist limit

# For whistles (mid freq, good freq resolution)
nperseg = 2048
noverlap = 1536
fmin = 2000
fmax = 20000
```

## üéì Lessons Learned (Update as You Go)

### What Works Well
- ‚úÖ Starting with 5-second chunks prevents runaway processing
- ‚úÖ Teager-Kaiser energy operator is effective for click detection
- ‚úÖ Threshold sweep (4/6/8) helps assess parameter sensitivity
- ‚úÖ Comparison between buoy and special files reveals false positive rates

### Gotchas
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't reference `reports/` directory until it's actually created
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Notebook variables persist between sessions (restart kernel for clean slate)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large spectrograms can consume lots of memory (work in chunks)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è EARS files are big-endian, 16-bit signed integers (library handles this)

### Parameters That Need Tuning
- üéöÔ∏è Click threshold_factor: 4 catches many, 6-8 more conservative
- üéöÔ∏è Whistle min_duration: 0.1s is lower bound, most are 0.5-1.5s
- üéöÔ∏è Smoothing window: 51 samples works, may need adaptation per file

## üìà Success Metrics

You'll know you're making progress when:

- ‚úÖ Whistle detection function runs without errors on test chunk
- ‚úÖ Visual inspection shows detected contours match visible whistles
- ‚úÖ Detection statistics (count, duration, frequency) are scientifically reasonable
- ‚úÖ Function works on multiple different files
- ‚úÖ Results are saved to disk and reproducible
- ‚úÖ Documentation is updated with findings

---

## üéØ Big Picture Goals

**Short-term (Next 1-2 Sessions):**
- [ ] Implement whistle detection function
- [ ] Test on 5-10 files
- [ ] Create visualizations of detected whistles
- [ ] Save results to `reports/` directory

**Medium-term (Next 5-10 Sessions):**
- [ ] Refine detection parameters based on validation
- [ ] Process full dataset (100 files) using batch framework
- [ ] Build summary statistics and visualizations
- [ ] Identify files with high whistle activity

**Long-term (Future):**
- [ ] Implement signature whistle matching
- [ ] Classify whistle types
- [ ] Temporal analysis (when do dolphins communicate?)
- [ ] Publish findings or create interactive visualization

---

## üê¨ Remember

You're not just writing code - you're helping understand how dolphins communicate! 

Every detected whistle is potentially a dolphin "name" or social signal. The patterns you find could reveal:
- Individual identification
- Social group structure  
- Behavioral patterns
- Communication complexity

Stay curious, be methodical, and document your discoveries!

## 💭 Notes for Next Team

### What You Should Know

1. **User is satisfied** - All requested features implemented
2. **Code is clean** - Well-documented, maintainable JavaScript
3. **Documentation is solid** - Clear handoff with technical details
4. **Ready to ship** - Or continue with enhancements

### Key Technical Details

- Drag functionality uses mouse + touch events
- State preservation pattern for seamless audio switching
- CSS `object-fit: fill` solved alignment issues
- Progress overlay uses percentage-based positioning
- Event listeners have proper cleanup functions

### Potential Next Steps (Optional)

- Add keyboard shortcuts (space, arrows)
- Make volume slider draggable
- Implement loading spinners
- Add waveform zoom feature
- Scale to more files (top 50 or 100)
- Implement click detection algorithm

### Where to Focus

- If enhancing player: See "Minor Polish" in HANDOFF_NOTES.md
- If scaling up: See "Scale Up" section
- If adding science: See "Advanced Science" section
- If user has new requests: Context is all in HANDOFF_NOTES.md
